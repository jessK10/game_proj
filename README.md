Pacman Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pacman game using Python's Turtle graphics library.
Description

This Pacman game consists of Pacman, represented by a yellow dot, and four ghosts, represented by red dots. The objective of the game is for Pacman to eat all the white dots on the screen while avoiding the ghosts. When Pacman eats a white dot, the score increases. The game ends when Pacman collides with any of the ghosts.
Features

    Pacman movement controlled by arrow keys.
    Ghosts move randomly throughout the game.
    Game over screen displayed when Pacman collides with a ghost.
    Victory screen displayed when all white dots are eaten.

How to Play

    Run the pacman.py file using Python.
    Use the arrow keys to control Pacman's movement:
        Up arrow: Move Pacman up
        Down arrow: Move Pacman down
        Left arrow: Move Pacman left
        Right arrow: Move Pacman right
    Eat all the white dots while avoiding the red ghosts.
    The game ends when Pacman collides with any ghost.
    If Pacman eats all the white dots, a victory screen is displayed.
